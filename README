Task based time management.

Directory 'src/' contains the main program which depends on json-io 4.12.0.
Directory 'tasks/' contains example Task definitions.

Main program do not need to be aware of Task types at compile time. Simply 
compile with json-io on the classpath.
Tasks can be compiled individually with main program on the classpath.

Compiled Task classes should be placed in the directory specified by the 
'task_types_dir' property in the 'balance.properties' file. Files in said 
directory will be loaded automatically at runtime.


TODO
